This is my attempt on getting a heavily compressed cyclegan model on to CoreML and ultimately running on IOS. First step was to compress the model using https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08936.pdf. I roughly compressed a Vangogh image filter model using their repo, then converted the model to onnx, hoping that a prebuilt converter would work to get it into coreml/tflite, but  coremltools, mmdnn, onnx2keras, and onnx-tf all failed. Now I am trying to manually convert the onnx model to keras by recreating the architecture and manually transfering weights/biases.
