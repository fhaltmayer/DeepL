Simple WGan with gradient penalty (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf) implementation, mainly used in order to figure out how Wasserstein loss works. 
Things to do:
- [x] Get Working
- [x] Clean up into runnable file
- [ ] Apply mixed precision (currently stuck with using mixed precision with autograd call in gradient penalty)
